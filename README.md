# CMPE-130-Project

This coding project is a food manager where it manages items, its quantity, and its shelflife in the user's inventory. To use this code, upload all the files into a c++ compiler. Run the project and the menu will pop up to show the choices provided to manage your inventory. To upload a list of items that you would like to add into your inventory, write it into the "Test.txt" with the format "name", "quanitity", "shelflife". Other options will be seen when the Menu pops up.
